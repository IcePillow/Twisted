Coordinates

        > Normal math has 0 at East and goes CCW
            > This is used in most situations
        > libGDX has 0 at North and goes CCW
            > This is used to calculate how to display on the screen
        > Nautical is 0 at North and go CW
            > This will be displayed to the player
