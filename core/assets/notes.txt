Game Launch Sequence
    > Lobby takes user input
    > Lobby sends Command over network to Server
    > Server tells LobbyHost
    > LobbyHost calls server.stopListening()
    > LobbyHost creates new thread that does
        > Tells players, kicks unnecessary players
        > Creates GameHost, during construction it
            > Copies over data from LobbyHost
            > Sends SceneChange to players
            > Creates thread that loads state, sends initial state
    > Lobby receives SceneChange
        > Creates Game
        > Transfers client contact to Game and GameHost to Game
        > Switches the graphics to Game scene
Coordinates
    It is unfortunate that I end up needing to use three different standards, but here we are.
        > Normal math has 0 at East and goes CCW
            > This is used in most situations
        > libGDX has 0 at North and goes CCW
            > This is used to calculate how to display on the screen
        > Nautical is 0 at North and go CW
            > This will be displayed to the player
