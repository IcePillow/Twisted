This is a game that I am making solo. It is inspired by the MMO Eve Online. The idea is to have a
2D RTS desktop game. The graphics will be very simple, since I am focusing solely on the coding.


Why is it called Twisted?
    It may be a temporary name. I chose Twisted in honor of the now-removed mode of League of
    Legends called "Twisted Treeline".
    
What are you using to make it?
    It is written completely in Java. Graphics are handled by LibGDX. Networking is done manually.

When will it be playable?
    Not sure, depends on how much free time I find to work on it.
