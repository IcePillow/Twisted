This is a game that I am making solo. It is inspired by the MMO Eve Online. The idea is to have a
2D RTS game. The graphics will be very simple, since I am focusing solely on the coding.

Why is it called Twisted?
    It may be a temporary name. I chose Twisted in honor of the now-removed mode of League of
    Legends called "Twisted Treeline".

When will it be playable?
    Not sure, depends on how much free time I find to work on it.
